# livedemo
This small repository is created as part of live demo presented on 2018-06-17.
It is primarily intended for people to get started.

Here are the instructions to set up and validate on your PC

* Setup IDE, preferably intellij with Scala and Spark
* Setup data sets from this github repository - https://github.com/dgadiraju/data
* We have used data/retail_db and data/retail_db_json for the demonstration purpose
* Make sure application.properties is updated based up on the paths on your PC
* All the programs in retail_db package take one argument, make sure you pass it while running the program
* In IntelliJ you can pass the run time arguments by editing configuration for given file with main function

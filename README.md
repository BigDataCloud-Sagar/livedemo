# livedemo
This small repository is created as part of live demo presented on 2018-06-17. Click [here](http://discuss.itversity.com/t/getting-started-with-spark-2-using-scala-20180617/13160) for the archive of the video.
It is primarily intended for people to get started.

Here are the instructions to set up and validate on your PC

* Setup IDE, preferably intellij with Scala and Spark. Click [here](https://kaizen.itversity.com/setup-development-environment-intellij-and-scala-big-data-hadoop-and-spark/) for detailed blog about setting up the environment.
* Setup data sets from this github repository - https://github.com/dgadiraju/data
* We have used data/retail_db and data/retail_db_json for the demonstration purpose
* Make sure application.properties is updated based up on the paths on your PC
* All the programs in retail_db package take one argument, make sure you pass it while running the program
* In IntelliJ you can pass the run time arguments by editing configuration for given file with main function
